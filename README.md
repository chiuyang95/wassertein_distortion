# Wassertein Distortion
Wasserstein distortion is a one-parameter family of distortion measures that was recently proposed to unify fidelity and realism constraints. For definition please see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480168).

This repository contains implementations for metamer reconstruction under Wasserstein distortion as seen in [Wasserstein distortion: Unifying fidelity and realism](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480168), and intrinsic $\sigma$-map algorithm as seen in [Wasserstein distortion with instrinsic $\sigma$-map](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8lwDe1eOTV).
