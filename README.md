# Wassertein Distortion
Wasserstein distortion is a one-parameter family of distortion measures that simultaneously generalizes pixel-level fidelity on the one hand and realism on the other. Wasserstein distortion represents a generalization and synthesis of prior work on texture generation, image realism and distortion, and models of the early human visual system, in the form of an optimizable metric in the mathematical sense.For detailed definition please see [paper1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03629). Please also refer to [paper2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10619196) for some information-theoretical guarantees of Wasserstein distortion, and [paper3](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8lwDe1eOTV) for improved framework of the distortion measure.

This repository contains implementations for selected experiments in [paper1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480168) and [paper3](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8lwDe1eOTV).
